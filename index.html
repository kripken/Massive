        <div class="answer">
          <p>asm.js appears in one test in <a href="https://developers.google.com/octane/">Octane</a>, and in several
           tests in <a href="http://browserbench.org/JetStream/">JetStream</a>, which is great, but several aspects of asm.js performance are
           not fully measured in those. In particular, asm.js
           often appears as large (you might even say <b>massive</b>) source files, which can have different performance characteristics than the typical
           small programs appearing in most benchmarks. For example, a very large codebase may contain very large functions,
           which due to their size are difficult to optimize efficiently (either not fully optimized, or optimized slowly in a noticeable way),
           or just the sheer number of functions may be very high and cause the browser to pause as the codebase is parsed and starts to execute.
           Such very large codebases can therefore bring new challenges to JavaScript engines (or rather, more extreme versions of familiar challenges),
           and it is important to measure performance on them because they are showing up with increasing frequency on the web (for example,
           as native plugins are fading out, game engine companies like <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and
           <a href="http://unrealengine.com/">Epic</a> are starting to compile their large codebases to asm.js).
           For these reasons, the Massive benchmark includes several very large codebases (Poppler, SQLite, etc.), and measures throughput as well as
           responsiveness, variability and startup time (see details below).</p>

        <h3 class="section-heading"><a aria-hidden="true" class="section-anchor" name="faq-how_does_this_relate_to_Emscripten" href="#faq-how_does_this_relate_to_Emscripten">How does this relate to the Emscripten benchmark suite? What does this offer over that?</a></h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The <a href="http://kripken.github.io/embenchen/">Emscripten benchmark suite</a> evolved over time in order
           to benchmark Emscripten itself, and therefore mainly focused on throughput, and is runnable in both shell and
           browser. Massive, on the other hand, tests not just
           throughput but also browser responsiveness and other factors that only make sense when running in a browser, things
           not measured by the Emscripten benchmark suite (or by the main JavaScript benchmarks).</p>
        </div>
        <a aria-hidden="true" name="faq-explanations"></a>
        <h3 class="section-heading"><a aria-hidden="true" class="section-anchor" name="faq-what_do_the_categories_mean" href="#faq-what_do_the_categories_mean">What do the categories ("Main Thread Responsiveness", "Throughput", "Preparation", and "Variance") mean?</a></h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p><b>Main Thread Responsiveness</b> measures the user experience as a large codebase is loaded. What is tested is whether
           the main thread stalls as the codebase is prepared and executed for a short while. The score here can be improved
           by parsing the code off the main thread, for example. This does <b>not</b> measure how much time is spent,
           but only how responsive or unresponsive the user experience is (how much time is spent is measured by
           Preparation, and to some extent Throughput). Technically, we measure responsiveness by seeing if events on
           the main thread execute at the proper interval (as when the main thread stalls, it stalls both the user
           experience and other events).</p>
          <p><b>Throughput</b> measures how fast a large computational workload runs. This is what is typically measured by
           benchmarks. Massive's throughput tests focus on very large real-world codebases.</p>
          <p><b>Preparation</b> measures how long (in wall time) is spent to get a codebase ready to execute, before
           executing any of it. This measures how much
           time passes between adding a script tag with that code and being able to call the code (this may or may not
           cause a user-noticeable pause, depending on whether it is parsed on or off the main thread; Main Thread Responsiveness
           tests that aspect). "Preparation" is basically all the time before code is actually able to run; that may include
           parsing, conversion to bitcode, JIT compilation, etc., depending on the JS engine.</p>
          <p><b>Variance</b> measures how variable the frame rate is in an application that needs to run in each frame
           (this is important in things like games, which must finish all they need every 1/60 of a second, in order to be
           smooth). Specifically, we run many frames and then calculate the statistical variance and worst case. Note that
           one VM might have a much faster overall frame rate than another, but also more variance: in general, given two
           VMs with the same average, the one with less variance is "better" since it's smoother. But given a different mean,
           things are less clear (perhaps we are happy to get some average slowdown in order to reduce variance which can
           cause noticable but rare pauses?). Hence we measure variance separately from throughput (which is a measurement of the total
           speed, and is proportional to the average).</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="section-heading"><a aria-hidden="true" class="section-anchor" name="faq-how_consistent_are_these_results" href="#faq-how_consistent_are_these_results">How consistent are these results between runs of the benchmark suite?</a></h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Most of the tests, in particular the throughput ones, are generally very consistent, as we run a deterministic workload
           in a web worker, which minimizes outside noise. We also run a few repetitions and average the results. However, in particular
           the Main Thread Responsiveness tests need to run on the main thread, and they involve DOM events like adding a script tag,
           setInterval, etc., which can be fairly variable. We run a larger amount of repetitions on those tests to average out the
           noise, but even so they appear to be less consistent between runs on some browsers.</p>
          <a aria-hidden="true" name="faq-toovariable"></a>
          <p>When we see the results of a test are too variable, we mark it with <b>"(±X%!)"</b> next to the score. The cause of such variability
            might be something else on your machine (perhaps a background indexing service happend to use a CPU core during a test, etc.),
            or it might be that the browser behaves unpredictably for some reason.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>All the benchmarks here are from real-world C or C++ codebases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Box2D</b>: A 2D physics engine, used in many games, for example Angry Birds. Stresses
                              floating-point processing performance. The workload is based on
                              <a href="https://github.com/joelgwebber/bench2d/">jgw's bench2D</a>. (~30KLOC)</li>
            <li><b>Lua</b>: A script language that is used in many games as well as on Wikipedia. Here the
                            entire Lua VM is compiled down to JavaScript, including interpreter, garbage
                            collector, etc. The workloads used are the scimark and binarytrees benchmarks,
                            which test raw computation and garbage collection, respectively. (~16KLOC)</li>
            <li><b>Poppler</b>: A PDF rendering engine, used by many applications, for example LibreOffice.
                                Rendering PDFs requires many capabilities (font rendering, graphics, etc.),
                                making this the largest of the codebases tested here, especially since it is
                                built together with the FreeType font rendering library. The workload is
                                Lawrence Lessig's "Free Culture". (~250KLOC)</li>
            <li><b>SQLite</b>: A complete transactional SQL database engine. Parsing and executing SQL
                               queries is done using a large interpreter-loop type function, which is
                               challenging to optimize. The workload is the SQLite speedtest1.c benchmark,
                               which SQLite devs constructed to represent real-world usage patterns. (~128KLOC)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these codebases are open source, so you can build and inspect them yourself (the build
          tool, <a href="http://emscripten.org">Emscripten</a>, is of course open source as well).</p>
          <p>Note that the KLOC numbers mentioned above do not include system libraries like libc and libc++,
             the necessary parts of which are necessarily included in the benchmarks.</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Generally quite a while, as it is designed to execute fixed workloads of sufficient length to
           measure real-world performance on large applications. How long it takes will depend on the machine and
           browser, of course, but you can probably expect it to take at least a few minutes (on a desktop or laptop
           machine; a mobile device may take much more). Massive should not lock up your
           browser as it runs, however - except for the Main Thread Responsiveness tests, which run first, benchmarks
           are run in web workers (and even the Main Thread Responsiveness tests should not reduce responsiveness
           very much). Note that results of individual benchmarks show up when ready, so you can view those
           before all of Massive is complete.</p>
